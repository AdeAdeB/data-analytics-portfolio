# Austin Bike Sharing Data Analysis

## Objective
Analyze bike sharing usage patterns to identify peak periods, popular stations, and user behavior trends.

## Dataset
Austin bike-sharing dataset (CapMetro).

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Insights

- **Popular Stations:** A small number of stations account for a disproportionately high number of trips, indicating strong location-based demand.
- **Peak Hours:** Bike usage peaks during weekday morning and evening hours, suggesting commuter-driven usage.
- **Subscriber Usage:** Subscribers consistently use the service more frequently than casual users, showing stable and predictable demand.
- **Days of the Week:** Weekend usage exceeds weekdays usage, reinforcing the role of bike-sharing for leisure.
- **Seasonal Variations:** Usage increases during favorable weather seasons and declines during colder or rainy periods.
- **Yearly Trends:** Overall usage shows growth over time, reflecting increasing adoption of the bike-sharing service.
- **Fleet Utilization:** Some bikes and stations are underutilized, indicating opportunities for redistribution and efficiency improvements.


## Business Recommendations

- Increase bike availability at high-demand stations during peak commute hours.
- Optimize fleet redistribution to reduce congestion at popular stations and improve usage at underperforming locations.
- Develop targeted subscription campaigns to convert casual users into long-term subscribers.
- Use seasonal demand patterns to inform maintenance scheduling and capacity planning.
- Monitor yearly usage trends to support data-driven expansion and infrastructure investment.
